## Firmware

For whatever reason, most education EV3 kits come with firmware v1.09H; if you didn't notice the H, that's the home edition. This short section will guide you on updating the bricks to v1.10E, the latest education edition firmware (as at writing). (The content of this section is based on this Reddit post: <https://www.reddit.com/r/mindstorms/comments/pcsacu/how_to_install_and_update_firmware_110e_on_an_ev3>)
