Code is a list of instructions, similar to a recipe, given to computers in order to complete various tasks.
Code is represented in a variety of different Programming Languages such as [C](@/wiki/cprog.md), Python or Scratch ([see EV3](@/wiki/ev3.md)).

## Managing Code

### Git

### Folder Structure

### Comments

Commenting code is an art unto itself; it should help any person (be it your friends or you in the future) understand what the code does and why certain style or logic choices were made as concisely as possible.

## Collaboration

### Mailing Lists

The simplest way to share your code is to create a 'mailing list' with your group members and add your program as an attachment. A mailing list is just a way to 'broadcast' emails to many people all at once.

Here's how you should set one up:

1. start writing a new email,
2. in the `'To'` field, add all your group member's emails,
3. in the `'Subject'` field, add a short and useful description - `'Robotics: T4W3 Code for Challenge 5`,
4. write in the `'Message'` box what is new or what has changed since last time,
5. attach the code - `'Insert > Attach File > Browse This PC'`
6. next time you send code, hit the `'Reply All'` button to automatically add your group members to the `'To'` field, but make sure to change the subject!
