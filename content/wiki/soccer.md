## Competition Divisions

### Standard

The Standard division is a Lego-only competition, and uses an infrared enabled soccer ball. It has seen the use of the 1st gen RCX, 2nd gen NXT, [3rd gen EV3](@/wiki/ev3.md) and will see the introduction of Raspberry Pi with the next gen SpikePrime. Robots are a maximum of 1kg, and must fit within a 22cm cylinder. It is a perfect entry level introduction to the rules and logic of the game of robot soccer.

### Lightweight

The Lightweight division uses an infrared ball also, but allows for greater flexibility in robot design. You can use electronics or stick with lego. Robots are a maximum of 1.1kg and must fit within a 22cm cylinder.

### Open

The Open division is the most advanced competition. A passive orange ball is used, so robots much use cameras and computer vision to track it. Robots can be made with anything, but typically use electronics such as [LiPo batteries](@/wiki/lipo.md) and the Arduino Mega board. Advanced materials such as 3D-printed plastics, laser cut wood or carbon-fibre are often applied. Omniwheels are also a popular movement option, allowing free motion in any direction. Robots are a maximum of 2.5kg and must fit within a 22cm cylinder.
