Lithium Polymer (better known as LiPo) batteries are a high density energy storage component. Made up of individual cells, the voltages of each are summed in series for the total output voltage of the battery.

## Usage

Storage between 3.6V and 3.8V per cell - recommended to be closer to 3.6V. Maximum charge to 4.2V per cell. Never let LiPo go below 3.1V per cell. Batteries must be kept in fireproof bags both when charging and not in use.

| Situation      | Cell | 3S    | 4S    |
|----------------|-----:|------:|------:|
| Minimum Charge | 3.1V |  9.3V | 12.4V |
| Low Charge     | 3.3V |  9.9V | 13.2V |
| Storage Charge | 3.6V | 10.8V | 14.4V |
| Maximum Charge | 4.2V | 12.6V | 16.8V |
