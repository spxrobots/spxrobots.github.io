## SSH/Email Concerns

* Slow, time-consuming
* Steep learning curve
* Reliant on staff to accept changes via complex Git email

## Primary Implementation Options

### Option 0 - Absolute Privacy

* No accounts
* Git `Student <>` for every student, no identifer at all.

### Option 1 - Managed Privacy

* No accounts
* Git `Groupname <>`, substituting in group name as appropriate.

### Option 2 - Self-Managed Privacy

* Accounts on Private repos only
* Git groupname or otherwise on public repos
* Difficult privacy-practice hygiene

### Option 3 - Open Source

* Accounts for all git operations, still using GitHub anonymous email
